A soup to nuts full-stack project and process.

# Why?
My reply to the question "What is your design/development approach" usually begins with "It depends" or "Whatever works." It is not a hedge. My projects have been quite varied, so "my approach" has been too. In this project, i will explore a simple default approach and see where it takes me. 

# ProjectN Goals
1. Discover/try/document a default approach
2. Make the approach intelligible/repeatable
2. Get a backlogged project done
